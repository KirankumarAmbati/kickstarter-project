Kickstarter
[Problem Statement]

Develop a pseudo front end application which would let the users help list and browse top Kickstarter projects conveniently.

 

[Minimum Requirement]

- Use of Web API to fetch project details.

 

Utilise Response Parameters:

                [s.no, amt.pledged, blurb, by, country, currency, end.time, location, percentage.funded, num.backers, state, title, type, url].

Implement functionality to list project details in a web page.

- Visually interactive responsive design listing all the projects.

- Zip all your Source code, Screenshot, & Deployment Instructions and upload.

 

[Plus Point]

- A feature to Search (via name).

- Implement Sort feature (to filter result through -percenatge funded- in ascending and descending order).

- Use your imagination and add features which would make things easier for end users.

- Zip all your Source code, Screenshot, & Deployment Instructions and upload.

 

[Extra Work]

- Implement feature to sort projects based on end time.(Sort based on old-to-new and new-to-old).

- Add autocomplete feature to Search projects conveniently.

- Your frontend should load in less than few seconds. Implement lazy loading for slower frontends. (Look resources in this document to implement fast frontend.)

- Custom elegant design, fonts and icons to make web app more user-friendly.

- You may add portfolio activity comprising awesome work you have done on web application(s).
